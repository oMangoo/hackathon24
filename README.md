codedex's 2024 summer hackathon!

Olympic Oracle (Swim Edition üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) by Malia


About Me

Hi, I'm Malia. For my first hackathon, I chose to predict the winning times of any swim event of the 2024 Paris Olympics (oh boy). I'm a newbie when it comes to data science and I spent a lot of this hackathon just learning how to build models and making it do something üíÄ Even though it was a struggle at first, I eventually got the hang of it and applied my newfound knowledge for this project. I'm a swimmer and thought it'd be cool to be able to predict not just olympic champions swim times, but maybe even my own.


Project

Initially, I built a model (under olympics_medals) that predicts the winners of the Paris Olympics After (like number of gold medals each country earned), however I switched gears to focus on my swimming concept (under olympics_swim) as it has a more practical use in my life. After figuring out how to load up my datasets and how to clean them, I evaluated and tested a few different models and ended up using a random forest regressor model. I was able to achieve the best results with this model, using ploty express on google colab to visualize this.


Future

This was my first hackathon, but it won't be my last. Though it didn't seem like it at the time, the healthy stress was kinda fun and I loved learning more about data science (thanks miracle). Building a model that makes actual predictions was mindboggling to me but now that I actually did it, I feel so accomplished. I will be making adjustments and improvements to better this project and so I can use it in my life. This was an awesome experience, thanks yall.
