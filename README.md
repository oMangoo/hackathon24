codedex's 2024 summer hackathon!

Olympic Oracle (Swim Edition 🏊‍♀️) by Malia

About Me
Hi, I'm Malia. For my first hackathon, I chose to predict the winning times of any swim event of the 2024 Paris Olympics (oh boy). I'm a newbie when it comes to data science and I spent a lot of this hackathon just learning how to build models and making it do something 💀 Even though it was a struggle at first, I eventually got the hang of it and applied my newfound knowledge for this project. I'm a swimmer and thought it'd be cool to be able to predict not just olympic champions swim times, but maybe even my own.

Project
I evaluated and tested a few different models and ended up using a random forest regressor model. I was able to achieve the best results with this model and I was able to visualize this using ploty express on google colab.
